1) What is JavaScript?
    • JavaScript is a high-level, versatile programming language 
    that is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. 
    • It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS.
    • JavaScript enables developers to make web pages more dynamic and user-friendly by adding 
    interactivity, such as form validation, animations, and complex user interfaces.

2) What are JavaScript Data Types?
    Undefined
    Boolean
    number
    string
    object

3) Explain the difference between var, let, and const.
    • var: Function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope.
    • let: Block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope. It is not hoisted.
    • const: Block-scoped and cannot be updated or re-declared. 
    The value assigned to a const variable is immutable,
    but the object it refers to can still be modified.

4) What is hoisting in JavaScript?
    Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope 
    (function or global) before code execution. 
    This means that variables and function declarations can be used before they are declared. 

5) Explain the difference between == and ===.
   • `==` : The loose equality operator that compares two values for equality 
    after converting both values to a common type.
   • `===`: The strict equality operator that compares two values for equality 
    without converting their types. It returns true only if the values and types are the same.   

6) What is the difference between null and undefined?
   • null: An assignment value that represents "no value" or "no object." 
     It is an intentional absence of any object value.
   • undefined: A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. 
     It also represents the absence of value but is more about unintentional or unknown absence.

7) What is a Function in JavaScript?
    A function in JavaScript is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
    Functions are reusable and can be called anywhere in the code to execute the code block. 
    They can accept inputs (known as parameters), perform operations, and return outputs.

8) Types of Functions in JavaScript
    1. Named Functions
                These are functions that have a name when they are defined. 
                They are the most common type of functions.
    
    2. Anonymous Functions
                These are functions that do not have a name and are often used as arguments 
                to other functions or assigned to variables.

    3. Arrow Functions
                Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. 
                They are always anonymous and have a different behavior for this compared to 
                traditional functions.

    4. Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
                These are functions that are defined and immediately executed. 
                They are often used to create a new scope.

9) What is DOM ?
    The Document Object Model (DOM) in JavaScript is a programming interface for web documents. 
    It represents the structure of a web page in a tree-like format, 
    where each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or piece of text. 
    The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, 
    and styling of a web page dynamically.

    Key Points about the DOM:
    
    • Tree Structure: The DOM represents a document as a tree of nodes, 
    where each node is an object representing a part of the document 
    (e.g., an element, an attribute, or a text node).
    
    • Manipulation: Through the DOM, JavaScript can modify the content, style, 
    and structure of a web page. This includes changing text, adding or removing elements,
    modifying attributes, etc.
    
    • Event Handling: The DOM allows JavaScript to respond to user interactions, 
    like clicks or keypresses, by handling events.
    
    • Cross-Platform: The DOM is a standard interface that is supported across different web browsers, 
    making it a fundamental part of web development.

10) What is Hoisting in JavaScript ?
     Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declerations are 
     moved to their top of theri containing scope uring the compilation phase, allowing them to use 
     before they are declared.
