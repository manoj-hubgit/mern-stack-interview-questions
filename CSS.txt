                                         CSS
1) What is CSS?
•   CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
•   CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
•   CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
•   External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

2) What are the different ways to include css styles in an html document?
    External CSS.  <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
    Internal CSS.  <style>
                    body {
                    background-color: linen;
                         }
                   </style>
    Inline CSS.    <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

3) What is the box model in CSS?
    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
    It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.   
    • Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
    • Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    • Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    • Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent  

4) Position property and it's type
    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element 
    (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
    • Static:
         Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
         This is the default value.

    • Relative:
         Same as static. But lets you add top, right, bottom, left.
         Makes it move relative to it's normal position
         
    • Absolute:
         Removes from the flow and positions absolute wrt to the parent. 
         Parent has to be relative or absolute for top, right, bottom, left to work. 
         Else it considers the main html element as the  parent .

    • Fixed:
         An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport,
         which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

    • Sticky:
         A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
         It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the 
         viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
